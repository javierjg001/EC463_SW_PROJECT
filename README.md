<h2>Overview</h2>
This web application was created using React and Firebase for EC463.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
Our approach to building the app as a partnership was based on maximizing learning, as neither of us have worked with React or Firebase before. This meant that we both wanted to contribute to the backend to learn how to build a web application using Firebase.
<br /><br />
We decided to both attempt to build a working React application individually, while relying on each other as resources. This is reflected in the state of the repository, which has multiple branches. After finishing backend functionality, we decided to move on to front-end development using one of the builds to simplify the workload.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
- API Version changes, many tutorials on old versions
- Installing dependencies
